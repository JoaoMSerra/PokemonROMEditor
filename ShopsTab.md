This tab allows you to edit the items available at each shop.

There is 1 shop that is not used in the game so it is a good place to remove some items if you want to add extra items to other shops.

The "Shop Items Left" tells you how many extra items you have available to place in shops.

Prices of items are changeg in the [Items Tab](https://github.com/jakefordyce/PokemonROMEditor/blob/master/ItemsTab.md).
