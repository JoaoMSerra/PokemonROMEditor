This tab lets you edit the Wild Encounter data for each area in the following ways:

* Zone Encounter Rate - how often you encounter a wild pokemon
* Spawn chances and species for each pokemon
* Level of wild pokemon

Keep in mind that every slot does not need to be different. If you want a certain pokemon at a certain level to spawn with a higher rate you can put the same pokemon/level in multiple slots.
