This tab lets you edit the Types in the following ways:

* Change the name of types \*
* Change the effectiveness of types
* Add new types \*\*

\*Using this you can also change whether a type uses Attack or Special for its damage. All of the slots before "Fire" use Attack. "Fire" and anything after it uses Special. If you wanted to for example make Dragon use Attack and Ghost use Special you could rename the original Ghost type to Dragon and the original Dragon type to Ghost.

\*\*There is limited space for types so be careful about how many types you add.
