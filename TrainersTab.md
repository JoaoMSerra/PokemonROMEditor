This tab lets you edit the Trainers in the following ways:

* Add or remove pokemon to their party
* Change their Levels
* Change which Pokemon they use

**Trainer Names Explained**

Each trainer's name is followed by a number. The number is to help you know exactly which trainer you are editing. When viewing the Map Tab you will see a trainer group as well as the trainer number. The number on this tab is the same number shown on the Map Tab.

**Trainer Bytes Left Explanation**

At the top of the Trainer info is a number labeled "Trainer Bytes Left". There is a limited amount of space for trainer data. If you want to add extra pokemon to 1 trainer you will need to remove pokemon from a different trainer. Also, be careful when changing the "All Same Level" because trainers whose pokemon are all different levels take up more space.
