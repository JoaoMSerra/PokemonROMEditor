This tab lets you edit the game's maps in the following ways:

* Change the tileset
* Change the background tiles
* Change the location of each object
* Change the sprite of each object (first dropdown box)
* Change whether the object stays put or walks around
* Change the facing direction of objects that stay put
* Change the walking range of objects that walk around
* Change the Trainer Group and Number (reference the Trainers Tab to see the trainer's pokemon) \*
* Change which items are found
* Change the single fight Pokemons' species and level (Moltres, Mewtwo, Voltorb, etc..) 

\*I do not know what happens if multiple objects point to the same trainer. Be careful when changing ths one.

I haven't added the ability to move the warps yet so I recommend leaving any ladders/doors/etc where they are or it might cause some confusion.
