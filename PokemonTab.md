This tab will allow you to edit the following information for each Pokemon:

* Base Stats (Attack, Defense, etc.)
* Starting Moves
* Catch Rate (how easy/hard it is to catch)
* Exp Yield (exp gained for defeating the pokemon)
* Growth Rate (how fast the pokemon levels up)
* Types
* Evolutions
* Compatibility with TMs and HMs
* Moves learned through leveling

There is also a grid view to make it easier to compare the pokemon as well as sort them by each stat or type

**Move Bytes Left Explanation**

Above the level up moves is a number labeled "Move Bytes Left". There is currently a limited amount of space in which all pokemon's evolution and level up moves data is stored. This means that if you want to add a new level up move (or evolution) to a pokemon you must first remove a level up move (or evolution) from another pokemon.
